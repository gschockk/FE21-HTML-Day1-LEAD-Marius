    <h2>One Republic</h2>

    <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
      <p>
      When I was a young boy living in the city <br>
      All I did was run, run, run, run, run <br>
      Staring at the lights, they look so pretty <br>
      Momma said, "Son, son, son, son, son" <br>
      "You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old" <br>
      "All that glitters don't turn to gold" <br>
      "But until then, just have your fun" <br>
      "Boy, run, run, run, run, run"
    </p></div>

    <p><span>Yeah, run, run, run <br>
    Run, run, run </p></span>
    <p></p>

    <div><p>
      When I was a young kid living in the city <br>
      All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay <br>
      And every single dime that good Lord gave me<br>
      I could make it last
      three, four, five days <br>
      Living it up but living down low <br>
      Chasing that luck before I get old <br>
      And looking back, oh, we had some fun Boy, run, run, run,
      run, run
    </p></div>

    <p>
      They tell you that the sky might fall <br>
      They'll say that you might lose it all <br>
      So I run until I hit that wall Yeah, Iâ€¦ <br>
