    <p>HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.</p>
    
    <h1>This is Heading 1 using H1 </h1>
    <p> The H1 HTML tag is usually used for the title of a page or post and it is the first header visible on a page. 
      The formatting of an h1 usually differs from the rest of the header tags found on a page (h2, h3, h4). </p>

    <h2>This is a Heading 2 using H2</h2>
    <p> H2: Relevant Header 2 text guides visitors to a specific section of web content. </p>

    <h3>This is Heading 3 using H3 </h1>
    <p> The H3 is used a subheading for H2 </p>

    <h4>This is a Heading 4 using H4</h4>
    <p> The H4 is used a subheading for H3 </p>
    
    <h5>This is Heading 5 using H5 </h5>
    <p> The H5 is used a subheading for H4 </p>
